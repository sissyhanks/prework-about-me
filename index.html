      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a registered yoga teacher transitioning into the field of web development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy interpreting symbols and like to follow astrology and read tarot.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My ideal work environment is one in which each team member understands the global vision of the venture they are supporting. Clarity around a universal goal provides a framework that fosters effective collaboration and trust in individual decisions.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live with my husband and elementary-school-aged child in Upper Arlington, Ohio.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After nearly a decade in the yoga industry, I took time off to stay home with my young child. Once my daughter was at an age where meeting her needs did not demand so much of my time, I began to think about other ways I might like to be useful in the world. I took the advice found on so many life coaches’ blogs to look for my passion by looking at what I was passionate about as a child. I kept returning to the memory of playing with BAISC on my TI-99 and PET computers. Those memories helped me to decide to pursue web development. I’m excited about the prospect of lifelong learning about the subject and the projects and individuals I will have a chance to encounter in this field.</p>
